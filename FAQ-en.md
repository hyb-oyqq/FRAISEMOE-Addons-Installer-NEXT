## **üîÑ Usage/Flow:**

1. Download "FRAISEMOE Addons Installer NEXT.exe" from the repository.
2. **Close any running games from the ["Applicable Games"](#-applicable-games) list.**
3. If the application asks for administrator privileges, grant them. **If administrator privileges cannot be obtained, the application will not run and will exit automatically.**
4. If the application asks to close a running game, select "Yes". **If the running game cannot be closed, the application will not run and will exit automatically.**
5. After launching the application, select "Start Install" and choose the **parent directory of the game directory.**<br />

   > **Important Note 1** ‚ùì What is the "parent directory of the game directory"? How to get it?
   > Taking Steam as an example, find the "Library" tab at the top, then find a [patchable game](#-applicable-games) in the game list on the left;<br />Right-click the game in the list, select "Manage" -> "Browse local files" to get the game directory. Then, click the "‚Üê" button in the address bar. If you see the [game's folder, e.g., "NEKOPARA Vol. 1"](#-applicable-games) in the file explorer, then this is the parent directory of the game directory. Select and copy the full path from the address bar.

   > **Important Note 2** ‚ùì How to use this tool for games from third-party installers?
   > Since the installation path for third-party games is not fixed, please copy the parent directory path of the game directory yourself, similar to the method for Steam.

   > Example (for illustration only, do not copy directly):
   > Game folder: C: (drive letter may vary)\Steam\steamapps\common\NEKOPARA Vol. 1
   > Parent directory of game directory: C: (drive letter may vary)\Steam\steamapps\common

6. In the folder selection dialog, **paste the copied path into the address bar** and click "Select Folder".<br />**(Note whether the text next to the "Select Folder" button is the last folder name in the path. If not, you may need to re-select).**

   > ‚àö Correct Example (for illustration only, do not copy directly):
   > Path entered in the address bar above: C: (drive letter may vary)\Steam\steamapps\common
   > Folder name below: common

7. After selecting the folder, you may encounter the following situations:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><h5>Status</h5></td>
        <td><h5>Action</h5></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game exists, but patch is not installed</td>
        <td>Proceeds directly to download task</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game exists,<br />but patch is installed from another source or patch file is corrupted</td>
        <td>Asks whether to reinstall the patch from this tool. If the patch from another source is usable, you can choose not to reinstall</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game does not exist</td>
        <td>Skips the patch installation step</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game exists,<br />but the corresponding patch version cannot be installed with this tool</td>
        <td>Repeat the previous installation steps</td>
    </tr>
</table>

8. Confirm the final installation result, then select "Exit".
9. Enter the game and check if there are more options in "Settings". Or if you have previously entered the extra story and it appears in the "EXTRA" option, it means the patch was installed successfully. If none of the above is observed, repeat the installation steps.

## üî∞ Software Features:

- Detects installed patch files for ["Applicable Games"](#-applicable-games) and compares their [Hash (SHA-256)](#-hashsha-256-checksums) to verify integrity. If normal, it skips installation for that version;<br />If patches from other sources are used or patch files are corrupted, it asks whether to reinstall. If you choose to reinstall, it will automatically delete old patch files, download the patch package, and reinstall it.
- Detects all unpatched versions and performs installation tasks.

## ‚ùì FAQ & User Guide

---

<h4><u>„ÄêImportant„ÄëWhy did the download fail?</u></h4>

1. Please check if the "final folder" in the address bar of the "Folder Selector" matches the "Folder Name" below (above the "Select Folder" button). If they do not match, it will not work correctly. If this is not the issue, proceed to the next step.
2. Please check if the selected folder contains the [game folder](#-usageflow) (refer to step 5 in the usage flow). If the game folder does not exist, it will not work correctly. If this is not the issue, proceed to the next step.
3. Please check if your network environment is normal and the connection is stable. If this is not the issue, proceed to the next step.
4. If the installation result is displayed directly (i.e., the installation step was skipped), it means the path is incorrect and the game could not be identified. Please check the path and try again. <b>If you are using a non-Steam version, please find the relevant resources to install it yourself.</b>
5. Please go to [GitHub](https://github.com/hyb-oyqq/FRAISEMOE-Addons-Installer-NEXT) or the [domestic mirror site blog](https://blog.ovofish.com/posts/c54d3755.html) to <b>check if you are using the latest version. The application will not work correctly if it is not the latest version.</b>
